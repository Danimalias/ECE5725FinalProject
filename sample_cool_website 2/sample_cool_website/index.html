              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
                If you want to experience Las Vegas right in your own home then look no further because we have the perfect 
                solution for you. This project creates the mini Las Vegas sphere and it features some cool images that you might 
                see on the real sphere such as its infamous emoji and our home: the Earth. This light display will take you traveling 
                back to the city of lights. Using a persistence of vision illusion, this project uses a motor to spin a ring of 
                pulsing LEDs at a rate such that our eyes detect an illusion of an image from this movement.

              <h2>Design and Testing</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">To begin our journey, we first started our prototype 
                with a box fan as our base motor(kindly loaned to us by Professor Skovira) and a 28 Neopixel strip. 
                We found lots of 3D CAD designs online for a globe. These designs were able to be 3D printed, and so
                after some further investigating, we were able to find a ring design that would be able to fit with 
                our box fan. This CAD model had a hollow core and the ring width was just wide enough to fit the width 
                of the neopixels. It also conveniently had wire holes at the top and bottom of the ring, which allowed 
                us to attach external wires, power supplies, and sensors later. We also made sure that the radius of 
                the hollowed axel would fit snugly onto a DC motor, just in case the box fan idea does not work out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align:center;">
        <img class="img-rounded" src="pics/3D printed ring.png" alt="Generic placeholder image" width="480" height="240">
        </div>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;">3D Printed Ring Design With External Wiring Space
        </h4>

        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">After the ring and motor shaft was finalized, we then layed out 
          the electrical components and the overall electrical system. This included the microcontrollers, sensors, and 
          power considerations for our system. We then reviewed this design and setup with our lab teaching assistance 
          and finalized the first draft of our Las Vegas Sphere as shown below.
        </p>

        <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align:center;">

          </div>
          <h4 style="text-align:center;">Rough Draft of Schematic and Globe Setup</h4>
      
        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">After the overall picture was created, we then began assembling 
          all of the mechanical components of our Las Vegas Sphere. This began by building a wooden frame on top of our 
          box fan to create a more stable situation for the ring to spin on. This also gave us space to add the sensors 
          and created a mount for the Raspberry Pi.
        </p>
  
        <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align:center;">
          <img class="img-rounded" src="pics/fan1.png" alt="Generic placeholder image" width="240" height="240">
          </div>
          <h4 style="text-align:center;">Wooden Frame to Support Our Spinning Ring On Top of Fan Motor Knob
          </h4>
        
        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Once we had the frames, we then proceeded to attach our ring onto the 
          fan motor by hot gluing it directly onto the knob. After this was setup, we tested our design by turning on the box 
          fan motor to see the results. We then noticed that the spinning of the motors caused everything to vibrate and shake 
          which then resulted in the globe created by the ring spinning to be shaking as well. Thus this then resulted in a shaky 
          globe or image. To further stabilize our system, we decided to build a wooden stool for the ring to lean on, in the sense 
          that we needed a better system other than hot glue to secure our ring, and we opted in for wooden planks and screws. 
          This created a secured ring that did not wobble and to finish our frame, we added a top piece of wood that was also screwed 
          on top of the slip ring to further stable our system. With this final attachment, we were completely satisfied with our 
          mechanical design and setup.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Moving onwards, we began implementing our electrical design. 
          This started with us researching more into Neopixels, specifically controlling them with a Raspberry Pi. 
          We chose to use Neopixel LEDs initially because these are a brand of individually addressable(programmable) 
          R(red)G(green)B(blue) LEDs. Each LED on the Neopixel LED strip can be individually controlled by communicating
          with the tiny integrated circuit within the strip. This was essential for our needs as we could then set the 
          color and brightness of each LED pixel, independently of the others just by broadcasting different commands 
          through the Raspberry Pi(or any other Arduino microncontroller). The Neopixel strip we had purchased was from 
          Adafruit, which allowed us to use their CircuitBlinka and Neopixel libraries with the Raspberry Pi. This 
          allowed us to easily program and control each LED using their pre-made functions. We tested these LEDs 
          by running a simple for loop of turning each LED on in a loop and spun them with our box fan. 
        </p>
  
        <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align:center;">
          <img class="img-rounded" src="pics/neopixel.png" alt="Generic placeholder image" width="240" height="240">
          </div>
          <h4 style="text-align:center;">Pulsing Neopixel with Raspberry Pi 4</h4>

          <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">This simple test made us realize that there were several things 
            we needed to consider with our project that we had not thought of before. To start, our LEDs are attached in 
            a spherical shape, so every image we would want to capture on our display would have to be deformed to fit 
            this shape otherwise the image would appear to be “squished”. Since we are using a single LED strip but 
            separated by a distance of the diameter of our ring, this created a “front strip” and a “back strip” that 
            we would then need to program accordingly to capture the 3D picture. Another concern we had was in regards 
            to the box fan motor, which rotates at varying speeds which can cause problems in displaying a clear stable 
            image. 
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">We began addressing these issues by starting with deforming our 
            input images to create a spherical image to display onto the globe. It turns out that many persistence of 
            vision projects had used a spherical display as it is very versatile to display multiple images in 360 degrees. 
            Thus with our research we were able to reference a sample code called genMatr.py that translated a normal 
            rectangle jpg or png into a spherical deformed image that had all of the pixels labeled and outputted a header 
            file that could be customized by the amount of LED pixels we had. Originally with the Neopixels, we had 28 
            LEDs in total, with 14 on each half of the ring and the resulting header file had a 1D array with all of the 
            pixel colors listed with headers to specify which image the header file is referring to. This array had a total 
            of 84 values with each triplet value representing the RGB value. This python script contains a deform sphere 
            method where it uses an angle calculation to produce the deformed image in pixel colors. 
          </p>

              <h2>Results and Conclusion</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">To conclude, this project really took us on a rollercoaster of 
                excitement, anxiety, and confusion. For both partners in this final project, neither of us had experience 
                with Dotstar LEDs and this class was our first chance in dealing with persistence of vision. Despite stepping 
                outside of our comfort zone in the beginning, we were able to overcome our roadblocks and setbacks, ultimately 
                creating a working prototype that displays images just like the LED sphere in Las Vegas, Nevada. Through this 
                process of testing and redesigning our prototype we learned that having an additional controlling pin, such 
                as the CLK(clock) pin on the Dotstar can really upgrade and increase the functionality of the project, in 
                the sense that the images became much more crisp and relayed our vision more accurately. We also learned that 
                common ground is extremely important when using different power sources as this can connect separate systems 
                into a whole. 
              </p>
      </div>

    <hr id='Further Exploration'>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Further Exploration</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Our project definitely leaves room for improvement, as any image 
                is now able to be portrayed onto the globe. We did test our globe with multiple images and we found that most 
                images taken from the internet would work, however images with higher contrast like the Raspberry Pi logo 
                performed better than images with a lower contrast like the Moon or Death Star. 
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">However with the genMatr.py file, the user can plug in any photo 
                and have it displayed onto the globe. Thus, in the future the Raspberry Pi can grab images from the web using 
                UDP communication and have the image data be transferred as a header file from the Raspberry Pi directly to the 
                ESP32, which would then broadcast the images appropriately onto the globe. The communication between the 
                Raspberry Pi and ESP32 would be much slower as the data transfer size is much larger, but this would still 
                allow the user to input any image in real time onto the globe. The main exploration would probably be surrounding 
                this communication bridge as well as the UDP communication protocols, as data loss in data transfer can be quite 
                delicate to work with, especially transfer larger bit sequences, such as the header file. Another hardware 
                improvement would be to solder together all of the connections to create a more permanent connection, thus 
                eliminating the random blinks from the LEDs as it spins, which would overall improve the user experience. 
                With these improvements made, further exploration could involve creating animations and rotating the images 
                on the globe, which we had thought of doing with multiple image frames in a loop and have the ESP32 grab 
                each image frame as time increases. This was not tested but theoretically would produce a rotating image 
                with some lag, further exploration can look into created a genMatrVideos.py file which would convert any 
                video into header files with all pixels colored.
